You are an expert full stack engineer. Build a production-ready **monorepo** for a startup called **PoojaOne**.

Goal:
Create a complete **frontend + backend** app for booking pandits (priests) for poojas in Bangalore, using **React** on the frontend, **Node.js (TypeScript) + Express** on the backend, and **Turso DB** (SQLite over libSQL) as the database.

==================================================
PRODUCT OVERVIEW
==================================================

Brand:
- Name: PoojaOne
- Concept: Online platform to book verified pandits for home/office poojas in Bangalore.
- Target users: Busy working professionals in Bengaluru.
- Launch zones: Whitefield, Koramangala, HSR Layout, Indiranagar.
- Supported poojas at launch (5):
  1. Griha Pravesh
  2. Satyanarayan Pooja
  3. Lakshmi Pooja
  4. Ganesh Pooja
  5. Rudrabhishek

Booking model:
- Service: Book a pandit to come home or office.
- Options per booking:
  - “Only priest service”
  - “Priest brings materials” (priest brings full pooja kit as per internal checklist)
- Hybrid booking flow:
  - If simple conditions are met, booking can be auto-confirmed.
  - Else status is "pending_confirmation" and ops will manually confirm later.

Languages:
- Kannada, Hindi, Telugu.
- User can optionally choose preferred language; if not available for chosen slot, booking still goes through as pending_confirmation.

Pricing:
- Use **price range placeholders** in the frontend, NOT actual payment integration for now.
- Just store base_price and kit_price_min/max in DB.

Tone & UI:
- Balanced modern + devotional.
- Primary color: **Navy blue**.
- Accent: **Gold**.
- Background: white / light.
- Clean, premium, no cheap religious-flyer look.

==================================================
TECH STACK & PROJECT STRUCTURE
==================================================

Overall:
- Monorepo style or root-level folder with:
  - `/frontend` for React
  - `/backend` for Node/Express
- Use TypeScript in both frontend and backend.

Frontend:
- React + Vite (preferred) + TypeScript.
- React Router for routing.
- Styling:
  - Use Tailwind CSS or simple CSS modules (your choice) but keep it clean and modern.
- Axios or Fetch for API calls.

Backend:
- Node.js + TypeScript + Express.
- REST API under `/api/*`.
- Use Turso DB as main database:
  - Use the official Turso/libSQL client for Node.
  - OR use Prisma ORM with libSQL driver (preferred for clean schema & migrations).

Database:
- Turso DB (SQLite on libSQL).
- Assume environment variables for connection:
  - `TURSO_DATABASE_URL`
  - `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN`
- Provide a clear place to configure this and a README section explaining it.

==================================================

==================================================
BACKEND REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

Set up an Express app with TypeScript and define these core routes (under `/api`):

Public endpoints:
1. `GET /api/poojas`
   - Returns list of active poojas with id, name, slug, description, duration, and price ranges.

2. `GET /api/poojas/:slug`
   - Returns detailed info about that pooja.

3. `GET /api/zones`
   - Returns the four launch zones.

4. `POST /api/bookings`
   - Request body:
     - pooja_id
     - zone_id
     - customer_name
     - customer_phone
     - customer_email (optional)
     - address_line1, address_line2, landmark, pincode
     - preferred_language (optional: "kannada", "hindi", "telugu")
     - with_kit (boolean)
     - booking_date
     - booking_start_time
   - Logic (simple v1 hybrid logic):
     - Try to find any active priest in that zone who:
       - supports the preferred_language if provided (if not provided, ignore language filter)
       - is free for that requested time window (based on availability_slots)
     - If found:
       - create booking with status = "confirmed" and assigned_priest_id set.
     - If not found:
       - create booking with status = "pending_confirmation" and assigned_priest_id = null.
   - Response:
     - booking object including status and a clear message:
       - If confirmed: “Your booking is confirmed. We’ll share priest details soon.”
       - If pending: “Your booking request is received. Our team will confirm availability shortly.”

5. `GET /api/bookings/:id`
   - Returns booking details including status.

Admin endpoints (basic, can be left with minimal auth or TODO):
6. `GET /api/admin/bookings` (list all or recent bookings)
7. `PATCH /api/admin/bookings/:id`
   - Allows updating status and assigned_priest_id.
8. `POST /api/admin/priests`
   - Add new priest with supported languages and zones.
9. `GET /api/admin/priests`

Backend specifics:
- Use environment variables for Turso DB connection.
- Implement a simple DB layer (Prefer Prisma with libSQL if possible).
- Include basic validation for request bodies.
- Enable CORS for the frontend origin.
- Provide a simple seeding script or endpoint to seed:
  - the four zones
  - the five poojas with placeholder descriptions and prices
  - a few sample priests and availability slots.

Add a README with:
- How to install dependencies
- How to set environment variables for Turso
- How to run migrations / seed script
- How to run backend dev server

==================================================
FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS

     - Pooja: dropdown fetched from `/api/poojas`.
     - Zone: dropdown fetched from `/api/zones`.
     - Booking date (date picker).
     - Booking time (time input or simple dropdown of time slots).
     - Preferred language (dropdown: Kannada, Hindi, Telugu, plus “No preference” option).
     - Service type: radio buttons:
       - “Only priest”
       - “Priest brings materials”
     - Customer details:
       - Name
       - Phone
       - Email (optional)
       - Address line 1
       - Address line 2 (optional)
       - Landmark (optional)

   - On submit:
     - Call `POST /api/bookings`.
     - On success:
       - Navigate to `/booking/:id` using the returned booking id.

4. Booking Status Page (`/booking/:id`)
   - Fetch booking detail from `/api/bookings/:id`.
   - Show:
     - Pooja name
     - Date & time
     - Zone
     - Service type (with or without kit)
     - Preferred language
     - Status:
       - If `confirmed`: show a green style message: “Your booking is confirmed.”
       - If `pending_confirmation`: show yellow style message: “Your booking is pending confirmation. We will update you soon.”
       - If `cancelled`: red style message.
   - Option: button to go back to homepage.

Styling:
- Use navy blue as main color for headings, navbar, and CTA buttons.
- Use gold for accents: button hover, section dividers, icons.
- Ensure full mobile responsiveness:
  - Stacked sections on small screens.
  - Cards become vertical on mobile.
- Keep typography simple and readable.

==================================================
OTHER REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

- Configure CORS properly so frontend (Vite dev server) can call backend.
- Include basic error states in UI:
  - If API fails, show friendly message and not just crash.
- Add `package.json` scripts for both frontend and backend:
  - `frontend`: `dev`, `build`
  - `backend`: `dev`, `start`
- At the repo root, add a simple README explaining:
  - How to run backend
  - How to run frontend
  - Turso DB setup basics and required env vars
  - Any seeding steps

Focus on:
- Clean code structure
- Clear separation of concerns
- Ready-to-extend API design
- Realistic but simple first version of the hybrid booking logic

This should result in a working full stack MVP that I can open in Replit, configure Turso credentials, seed base data, and start using to test bookings end-to-end.
